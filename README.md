## 🔍 System Overview

The system uses:

- **Logistic Regression** to predict whether the water pump should be ON or OFF based on environmental data.
- **Wokwi Simulation** with an **ESP32** microcontroller connected to virtual sensors for:
  - Soil moisture  
  - Temperature  
  - Humidity  
  - Rainfall
- A **SolidWorks mechanical model** representing the physical layout, including:
  - Centrifugal pump  
  - Water tank  
  - Piping
